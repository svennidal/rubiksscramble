# Rubiks Scramble
I made this simple rubiks scrambler that gives a list of moves that you follow to scramble your rubiks cube.

I once wrote a program that did this, but I can't find it so I made another one. It's a little slow since it uses a random number generator and only chooses adjacent moves.


### Quality of a program
Code could be abstracted more. Lot of repetetive conditionals.
